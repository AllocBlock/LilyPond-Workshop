LilyPond syntax highlighting in VSCode.

### Description

Based on [SubLilyPond](https://github.com/yrammos/SubLilyPond), this provides syntax highlighting for LilyPond in VSCode. It doesn't currently support embedded scheme code as SubLilyPond does.

### Installing SubLilyPond

Use your favorite tool to convert `lilypond.json` from json to plist and save it in the `lilypond/syntaxes/` as `lilypond.tmLanguage`. Then copy the `lilypond` directory to the `.vscode/extensions` directory in your home directory.
